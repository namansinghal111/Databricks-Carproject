# 🚗 Databricks Car Project – Data Engineering Pipeline

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline built on Databricks. It showcases modern ETL/ELT practices using Delta Lake, Delta Live Tables (DLT), Auto Loader, and Unity Catalog.

The solution follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ensure scalable, reliable, and high-quality data processing.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Flow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Uses Auto Loader for incremental file ingestion
* Supports structured and semi-structured data
* Schema inference and evolution enabled

### 2️⃣ Bronze Layer

* Stores raw ingested data
* Append-only operations
* Maintains data history

### 3️⃣ Silver Layer

* Data cleaning and transformation
* Handles null values, duplicates, and schema consistency
* Applies business rules

### 4️⃣ Gold Layer (Optional/Extendable)

* Aggregated and business-level datasets
* Ready for reporting and analytics

## 🚀 Key Features

* Scalable ETL pipelines using Spark
* Incremental data processing with Auto Loader
* Data quality and pipeline management using Delta Live Tables
* Centralized governance using Unity Catalog
* Optimized storage with Delta Lake (ACID transactions)

---

## 📊 Optimization Techniques

* File compaction (OPTIMIZE)
* Partitioning strategies
* Z-order indexing
* Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)

---

## 🔐 Data Governance

* Unity Catalog for centralized access control
* Role-based access
* Data lineage tracking

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Upload notebooks to Databricks workspace
2. Configure cluster
3. Set up Unity Catalog (if required)
4. Run Auto Loader for ingestion
5. Execute DLT pipelines

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add Gold layer dashboards
* Integrate with Power BI / Tableau
* Implement CI/CD pipeline
* Add real-time streaming use cases
